# ML-horse_test

Using python, write a decision tree algorithm that will learn to diagnose whether a patient is healthy or has colic. 
Use the horseTrain file to train the decision tree. Each training instance has 16 numeric attributes (features) and a classification, all separated by commas.
The attributes correspond to the following measurements made from each patient at admission to the clinic.
1. K
2. Na
3. CL
4. HCO3
5. Endotoxin
6. Aniongap
7. PLA2
8. SDH
9. GLDH
10. TPP
11. Breath rate
12. PCV
13. Pulse rate
14. Fibrinogen
15. Dimer
16. FibPerDim
In the decision tree, use only binary tests, i.e. each node should test whether a particular attribute has a value greater or smaller than a threshold.
In deciding which attribute to test at any point, use the information gain metric. 
Set the node test threshold for each potential attribute using this same metric i.e. at each point, see all the values that exist for a particular attribute in
the remaining instances, order those values, and try threshold values that are (half way) between successive attribute values. 
Use the threshold value that gives the highest information gain. 
Allow the same attribute to be tested again later in the tree (with a different threshold). 
This means that along a path from the root to a leaf, the same attribute might be tested multiple times. 
After learning the decision tree, use the horseTest file to test the generalization accuracy of the tree.
